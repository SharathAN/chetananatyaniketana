                <h3>Bharathanatyam</h3>
                <p>
                    Bharatanatyam is one form of South Indian classical dance. It was traditionally performed in Hindu
                    temples to worship Gods and Goddesses. The purpose of this course is for students to learn basic
                    postures, movements, and choreography of Bharatanatyam.

                <h3>Carnatic Vocal</h3>
                <p>
                    Carnatic music is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the Indian
                    subcontinent, with its area roughly confined to four modern states of India: Andhra Pradesh,
                    Karnataka,
                    Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. It is one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved from
                    ancient Hindu traditions;

                <h3>Veena Instrument</h3>
                <p>
                    The veena is one of the most ancient string instruments of India. Its origin can be traced back to
                    the
                    ancient yazh, a stringed instrument. Bharata, in his Natya Shastra, explains the theory of the 22
                    sruti-s in an octave with the help of two experimental veena-s.
