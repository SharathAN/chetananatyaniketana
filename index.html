                    Bharathanatyam is a classical dance form from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, practiced
                    predominantly in modern times by women. The dance is usually accompanied by classical Carnatic
                    music. It
                    dates back to 1000 B.C. This dance form improves the body language & brings a new expression on the
                    human face. This dance is a great physical activity; it requires a lot of movement. The good thing
                    about
                    this dance form, children can learn to be graceful and well coordinated. Dancing to the beat of the
                    carnatic music can also help their minds relax. This is a good outlet to keep them physically fit
                    and
                    have a sound mind. So this dance not only enriches the culture in students but also helps in
                    improving
                    their body language.
